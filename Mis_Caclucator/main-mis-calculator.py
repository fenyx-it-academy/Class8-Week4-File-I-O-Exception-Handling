## 4- Mis Calculator

# As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate basic  mathematical operations. 
# So that I can add, subtract, multiply or divide my inputs.

# **Acceptance Criteria:**

# * The calculator must support the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and  Division operations.
# * Define four functions in four files for each of them, with two float numbers as parameters.
# * To calculate the answer, use math.ceil() Â and get the next integer value greater than the result
# * Create a menu using the print command with the respective options and take an input choice from the user.
# * Using if/elif statements for cases and call the appropriate functions.
# * Use try/except blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for incorrect inputs.
# * Ask user if calculate numbers again. To implement this, take the input from user `Y` or `N`.
